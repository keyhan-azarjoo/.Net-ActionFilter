# Action Filter Attribute Overview
This repository provides an overview of action filters in ASP.NET Core, focusing on ActionFilterAttribute and IActionFilter. Action filters are essential components for injecting cross-cutting concerns into MVC controllers, such as logging and validation.

# ActionFilterAttribute
ActionFilterAttribute serves as a base class for creating custom action filters. By inheriting from this class, developers can override methods like OnActionExecuting and OnActionExecuted to inject logic before and after the execution of action methods. This approach is ideal for scenarios where filters need to be applied globally or at the controller/action level.

# IActionFilter
IActionFilter is an interface that defines methods to be implemented for action filters. Unlike ActionFilterAttribute, which requires inheritance, IActionFilter allows developers to directly implement interface methods for creating custom filters. This approach offers more flexibility, especially for conditional filter application or scenarios where inheritance is not preferred.


# Custom Action Filters Overview
This repository provides an in-depth look at custom action filters in ASP.NET Core, focusing on ValidationFilterAttribute and LogActionFilter. Action filters are essential for injecting cross-cutting concerns into MVC controllers, such as validation and logging.

# ValidationFilterAttribute
ValidationFilterAttribute is a custom action filter designed to perform input validation before the execution of controller actions. It ensures that incoming requests meet specific criteria before being processed further, enhancing data integrity and application security.

# Key Features:
Validates incoming request parameters before they reach the controller.
Rejects invalid requests early in the pipeline, preventing unnecessary processing.
Customizable validation rules to suit application requirements.
LogActionFilter
LogActionFilter is a custom action filter responsible for logging the execution steps of controller actions. It intercepts the execution at various points, such as before and after the action method is executed, and before and after the result is executed.

# Key Features:
Provides insights into how controller actions are being processed.
Logs key information such as controller and action names for debugging and optimization.
Helps track the flow of requests through the application for troubleshooting purposes.
